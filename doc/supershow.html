<p>Current version: 2.3b</p>

<p><h2>What is it?</h2></p>
<p>SuperShow is a program that allows you to create a slideshow (in Adobe Flash format) from a PDF and an
audio file.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: you do a conference with a set of slides created with <b>Impress</b>,
<b>PowerPoint</b> or other tool. Someone (maybe you) recorded it as only audio, to make it
available in the net. Unfortunately it lacks the slides, so people who download the audio will have
to get them separately and try to imagine when to change to the next picture.</p>
<p>With a video recording there's the problem that, usually, the slides are quite unreadable, unless high
bitrates are used and the camera set near the screen.</p>
<p>Here is where SuperShow comes. With it you can take your slides (exported to PDF) and your audio/video
recording, and mix them in a single, small size, Adobe Flash file, which can be played from the net or
downloaded to be seen locally. SuperShow allows you to easily sincronize the audio and the slide transitions
and insulates you from the complexity of creating Flash files from Linux with SWFtools (ok, it's not so
complex, but requires you to use the keyboard :) .</p>

<p><h2>Installing SuperShow</h2></p>

<p>Before installing SuperShow you must install the following packages:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>GhostScript</li>
<li>SWFtools</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>PyGTK</li>
<li>GSTreamer</li>
<li>PyGST</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you can't find SWFtools in your package system, you can download the source code from:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.swftools.org/">http://www.swftools.org/</a></div></p>

<p>For Debian Etch user, there's a repository with an unoficial package. Just add this line to your /etc/apt/sources.lst</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center">deb http://www.mediasitomo.com/debian-swftools/ unofficial main</div></p>

<p>and install <b>swftools-nonfree</b>. If you know an Ubuntu repository with it, please contact me.</p>

<p>Now you can use <b>sudo ./install.sh</b> in order to install it in your system. It will create an entry
in your Gnome/KDE menu too. But if you don't have root privileges, you can still use SuperShow just launching
it from the directory where you uncompressed it, just with <b>./supershow.py</b>.</p>

<p>If you want to remove SuperShow, just use <b>sudo ./uninstall.sh</b>.</p>

<p><h2>Using SuperShow</h2></p>
<p>When you launch SuperShow, it will show the main window. Here is where you will do all the work.
<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main_empty.png" /></div></p>
<p>The first thing you have to do is start a new project. When you click the button, SuperShow will show
the <b>File selection</b> window:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="selectfile.png" /></div></p>

<p>Here you can choose the files with the presentation itself (remember: exported as PDF) and the audio or
video. The last one is played using GSTreamer, so it must be in a format that it understand. If you can
play it with Totem, it will work in SuperShow.</p>
<p>You have to choose the output directory and the filename you want for the output file too. SuperShow will
create a folder in that output directory, to store some temporary files, and finally will create the
final SWF file with the slideshow.</p>

<p>After choosing all the files, folder and filename, SuperShow will pre-generate the slides to show
during the sinchronization process, and finally will show again the main window, but now you have two
new possible buttons to press: <b>Load timeline</b> and <b>Next slide</b>.</p>

<p>To create the slideshow, you just have to press <b>Next slide</b> and SuperShow will start playing the
audio (and possible video) and show the first slide.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main_full.png" /></div></p>

<p>And now is easy: just click the <b>Next slide</b> button in the right moments to change to the next
slide, and SuperShow will store the timeline. If the slides are too small, just maximize the window.</p>
<p>When you reach the last slide, you must press the button once again to set the point where you want the
sound to stop. This allows you to maintain the last slide as many time as you want (for example, if there's
a part with questions after the presentation, and you want to maintain it).</p>
<p>When you end, you will be able to save the timeline list with
the <b>Save timeline</b> (to use them in a future using the <b>Load timeline</b> button), or create the
presentation itself just by clicking in <b>Create slideshow</b>. If you use this last option, SuperShow
will show the <b>Properties</b> dialog, where you will be able to choose the backend to transform the PDF
to SWF:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="properties.png" /></div></p>

<p>The best backend is <b>PDF2SWF</b> because the final quality is perfect, but has a little drawback:
it's limited to 65.535 elements. This means that it can fail with (very) complex presentations (PDFs with
a lot of text, pictures...). In this case, you can choose <b>GhostScript</b>. This backend generates a
JPEG with each slide, and paste them in the final SWF. It can manage very, very complex presentations,
but the final quality is poor. The <b>Picture resolution</b> field allows you to choose the final size
for the JPEGs (but be carefull: very big pictures can result in a sinchronization loss, due to the
extra work needed to uncompress such big JPEG).</p>
<p>The <b>JPEG quality</b> slider allows you to choose the quality for the pictures stored in the SWF
(bigger quality means bigger filesize). The <b>Audio delay</b> value allows you to adjust the
precise instant for the transitions in the case there's a delay: if the slides change too late, put a
negative value (like -400), and if the change too soon, put a positive value (like 250).
Remember that the value is in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds).</p>

<p>Finally, the checkbutton <b>Add control buttons (Play, Pause...)</b> allows to create slideshows without the
control buttons. The <b>Hide control buttons while the slideshow is playing</b> makes the control buttons to
slowly hide, allowing to fully watch the slides. Finally, the <b>Add button for "Play again"</b>, which allows
to create slideshows without a button to play it again when it ends.</p>

<p>After pressing the <b>Forward</b> button, SuperShow will generate the slideshow in the specified directory,
and then will return to the main window (in case you want to save the timeline). If there's an error 
(because the disk is full, or because the PDF is too complex) you can try again as many times as you need.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="example.png" /></div></p>
<p>This is a presentation running in Firefox. At bottom left you can see the menu to rewind 5 seconds, jump to
the previous slide, play/pause, jump to the next slide, and forward 5 seconds. At bottom center is the slide
counter, and at bottom right is the time counter. This menu is shown when the
mouse cursor is moved to the bottom part of the presentation, and hides itself when the mouse cursor leaves
it.</p>

<p><h2>File format for timeline</h2></p>

<p>The files with the timelines are very simple, and are human-readable, so is possible to fine-tune them if
needed, or even create them directly with a text editor.</p>

<p>The filename must end in <b>.supershow</b>, or SuperShow won't show it in the file list.</p>

<p>The first line must contain the string <b>supershow</b>, to identify the file and ensure it's a valid
timeline file.</p>
<p>Next comes one or more lines with commands. Currently only two commands are recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>time:</b> this command is followed by the time instant to change to the next slide. The time
must be expresed in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds). Timings are always absolute, to avoid
acumulative errors.</li>
<li><b>offset:</b> this command is followed by a time offset, expresed in milliseconds. SuperShow will add
this quantity to all the following <b>time:</b> commands, until a new <b>offset:</b> command is found. Is
usefull to fix audio delays.</li>
</ul>

<p><h2>File format for ActionScript template</h2></p>

<p>The template with the ActionScript code is stored at <b>/usr/local/share/supershow/script.base</b> or at
<b>/usr/share/supershow/script.base</b>. It's a pure ActionScript code, except for the fact that SuperShow
parses it to replace some tags with specific data. The tags has this format:</p>
<p align="center">{PREFIX:SUFIX}</p>
<p>The PREFIX part contains the tag type, and the SUFIX part contains the subtype. These are the currently
recognized tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>{filename:out}</b> is replaced with the output path and filename for the SWF file.</li>
<li><b>{filename:slides}</b> is replaced with the complete path where the slides are stored in SWF format.</li>
<li><b>{filename:audio}</b> is replaced with the complete path to the audio track in WAV format.</li>
<li><b>{filename:basepath}</b> is replaced with the output path and generic filename chosen by the user.</li>
<li><b>{filename:installpath}</b> is replaced with supershow's installation path, which can be <b>/usr/share/supershow/</b>
or <b>/usr/local/share/supershow/</b> (ended in slash). Useful to add files like the TrueType font for counters.</li>
<li><b>{maxtime:VAR}</b> is replaced by a sentence in the form <i>VAR=XXX;</i>, being XXX the number of slides in
the slideshow.</li>
<li><b>{timelist:VAR}</b> is replaced by a list of array definitions in the form <i>VAR[X]=YYY;</i> being
X a slide number and YYY the time instant when it must be shown.</li>
<li><b>{var:addbuttons}</b> is replaced by 1 if the user wanted to add a menu with Play, Pause, Forward... buttons,
or 0 if the user wanted a slideshow without them.</li>
<li><b>{var:autohidebuttons}</b> is replaced by 1 if the user wants the menu to be shown only when the mouse
cursor is in the bottom part of the slideshow, or by 0 if he/she wants it to be always visible.</li>
<li><b>{var:playagain}</b> is replaced by 1 if the user wants a button to play again the slideshow when it
ends, or by 0 if the user doesn't want it.</li>
<li><b>{var:XXXXX}</b> every unrecognized VAR tag will be replaced by 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tags can't contain into them blank spaces, carriage returns or semicolons, to avoid being confused
with code blocks.</p>

<p><h2>Command-line utility</h2></p>

<p>Is possible to use the utility <b>supershow-converter</b> to import or export between this format and
a simple list of times in format hour:minute:second.millisecond. This way, if you have a list like this one:</p>
<p>
0:0:8.12<br/>
0:0:45.3<br/>
0:1:2.018<br/>
...
</p>
<p>You can convert it to the format used in SuperShow with the command:</p>
<p align="center"><b>supershow-converter import input-file output-file</b></p>

<p>And you can reverse the conversion just using <b>export</b> instead of <b>import</b>.</p>

<!-- <p>It's possible to import timelines from <b>Audacity</b> too, just using the <b>audacity2supershow</b> utility
created by Ralph Zajac:</p>
<p align="center"><b>audacity2supershow input-filename</b></p>
<p>It will create a new file named <b>input-filename.supershow</b> with the timeline.</p> -->
